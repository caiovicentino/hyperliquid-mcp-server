# ============================================================================
# NETWORK CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Network Selection
#
# Description:
#   Specifies whether to connect to mainnet (live trading) or testnet (testing).
#   Mainnet transactions use real funds and cannot be reversed.
#   Testnet is for testing and uses testnet funds only.
#
# Options:
#   - mainnet  (default) - LIVE TRADING, REAL FUNDS
#   - testnet           - TESTING ONLY, TESTNET FUNDS
#
# Security Note: Start with testnet to verify your setup!
#
HYPERLIQUID_NETWORK=mainnet

# Mainnet API Endpoint
#
# Description:
#   REST API URL for Hyperliquid mainnet.
#   Do not change unless you're using a custom Hyperliquid instance.
#
# Default: https://api.hyperliquid.xyz
#
HYPERLIQUID_API_URL=https://api.hyperliquid.xyz

# Mainnet WebSocket Endpoint
#
# Description:
#   WebSocket URL for real-time data streaming from mainnet.
#   Used for market data subscriptions and real-time order updates.
#
# Default: wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws
#
HYPERLIQUID_WS_URL=wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws

# ============================================================================
# TESTNET CONFIGURATION (Optional)
# ============================================================================
#
# Uncomment the following lines to use Hyperliquid testnet instead of mainnet.
# Testnet is perfect for:
#   - Testing your bot strategy before live trading
#   - Learning the platform
#   - Verifying configuration without risk
#
# Instructions:
#   1. Get testnet funds from the Hyperliquid testnet faucet
#   2. Uncomment the lines below
#   3. Change HYPERLIQUID_NETWORK to "testnet"
#   4. Restart your server
#

# HYPERLIQUID_NETWORK=testnet
# HYPERLIQUID_API_URL=https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz
# HYPERLIQUID_WS_URL=wss://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/ws

# ============================================================================
# MCP SERVER CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Logging Level
#
# Description:
#   Controls the verbosity of server logging output.
#   Useful for debugging issues and monitoring server health.
#
# Options:
#   - DEBUG    - Detailed logging, includes all function calls and parameters
#   - INFO     - Standard logging, shows important events (default)
#   - WARNING  - Only show warnings and errors
#   - ERROR    - Only show critical errors
#   - CRITICAL - Only show system-level failures
#
# For production: INFO or WARNING
# For development: DEBUG
# For troubleshooting: DEBUG
#
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# ============================================================================
# RATE LIMITING & PERFORMANCE
# ============================================================================

# Rate Limit Weight Capacity
#
# Description:
#   Maximum API weight (request cost units) allowed per minute.
#   Hyperliquid uses a weighted rate limiting system where different
#   endpoints consume different amounts of weight.
#
# Hyperliquid's limits:
#   - Standard accounts: 1200 weight per minute
#   - Higher tier accounts: up to 2400 weight per minute
#
# Recommendations:
#   - Start with 1000 to stay within safe limits
#   - Monitor usage and adjust based on your needs
#   - Higher values = faster but with risk of hitting limits
#
# Weight costs (approximate):
#   - Market data: 1-10 weight per request
#   - Trading: 20-50 weight per request
#
RATE_LIMIT_WEIGHT=1200

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL TRADING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Default Slippage Tolerance
#
# Description:
#   Maximum acceptable price change (as decimal) when executing market orders.
#   Protects against sudden price movements between order creation and execution.
#
# Example values:
#   - 0.001  = 0.1% slippage (tight, may fail on volatile assets)
#   - 0.01   = 1% slippage (moderate)
#   - 0.05   = 5% slippage (loose, for volatile assets)
#   - 0.1    = 10% slippage (very loose)
#
# Note: Only applies if using market orders or implicit slippage handling.
#
HYPERLIQUID_DEFAULT_SLIPPAGE=0.01

# Maximum Retry Attempts
#
# Description:
#   Number of times to retry failed API requests before giving up.
#   Helps handle temporary network issues.
#
# Values:
#   - 1 = no retries, fail immediately
#   - 3 = retry up to 2 more times (default)
#   - 5 = retry up to 4 more times (for unreliable networks)
#
# Note: Each retry includes exponential backoff delay.
#
HYPERLIQUID_MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# Request Timeout Duration
#
# Description:
#   Maximum seconds to wait for an API response before timing out.
#   Prevents the server from hanging on slow or unresponsive API calls.
#
# Values (in seconds):
#   - 10  = fast timeout, may fail on slow connections
#   - 30  = standard timeout (default)
#   - 60  = slow timeout, waits longer for response
#
# Note: WebSocket operations use WS_TIMEOUT instead.
#
HYPERLIQUID_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30

# ============================================================================
# CONNECTION TIMEOUTS
# ============================================================================

# HTTP Request Timeout
#
# Description:
#   Timeout for all HTTP/REST API requests in seconds.
#
# Default: 30 seconds
# Range: 5-120 seconds
#
HTTP_TIMEOUT=30

# WebSocket Connection Timeout
#
# Description:
#   Timeout for WebSocket connections and subscriptions in seconds.
#   Includes timeout for initial connection establishment.
#
# Default: 60 seconds
# Range: 10-300 seconds
#
# Note: Must be higher than HTTP_TIMEOUT for WebSocket stability.
#
WS_TIMEOUT=60

# ============================================================================
# DEBUG & DEVELOPMENT
# ============================================================================

# Enable Debug Mode
#
# Description:
#   Activates detailed debugging output and verbose logging.
#   Also disables some safety checks for easier troubleshooting.
#
# Values:
#   - false = disabled (default, production mode)
#   - true  = enabled (development and debugging)
#
# WARNING: Do NOT enable in production!
# Debug mode may:
#   - Log sensitive information
#   - Print API responses with raw data
#   - Reduce performance slightly
#   - Disable some safety checks
#
DEBUG=false

# ============================================================================
# QUICK START GUIDE
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. TESTNET SETUP (Recommended First):
#    a. Get testnet ETH from Hyperliquid testnet faucet
#    b. Set HYPERLIQUID_NETWORK=testnet
#    c. Uncomment TESTNET URLs
#    d. Test your configuration
#
# 2. MAINNET SETUP (With Real Funds):
#    a. Ensure testnet works perfectly first
#    b. Set HYPERLIQUID_NETWORK=mainnet
#    c. Use mainnet URLs (already default)
#    d. Start with small amounts
#
# 3. TROUBLESHOOTING:
#    a. Set LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG for detailed logs
#    b. Check that private key and address match
#    c. Verify network selection (mainnet vs testnet)
#    d. Check API endpoint URLs are correct
#    e. Ensure rate limit weight is appropriate
#
# 4. SECURITY CHECKLIST:
#    - Never commit .env to version control
#    - Use .gitignore to exclude .env
#    - Rotate keys periodically
#    - Use hardware wallets for mainnet
#    - Start with testnet for testing
